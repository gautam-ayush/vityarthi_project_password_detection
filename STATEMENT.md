# Password Strength Checker - Project Statement
# Problem Statement
Passwords are a primary method for securing personal and sensitive information online. However, many users create weak passwords that are vulnerable to attacks, putting their accounts and data at risk. There is a need for a simple and interactive tool that helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords and provides constructive feedback on how to improve them.
# Scope of the Project
This project involves the development of a non-GUI (command-line) password strength checker tool implemented in Python. The tool will evaluate passwords based on length and character diversity, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It will provide users real-time feedback and multiple attempts to create stronger passwords. The scope is limited to basic password strength assessment and user interaction through the terminal.
# Target Users
•	Individuals learning about cybersecurity basics and password creation
•	Students and educators looking for simple password checking tools for demonstrations or assignments
•	General computer users interested in quick and easy password strength evaluation without complex software
# High-Level Features
•	Password strength scoring based on length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters
•	Categorization of passwords into three levels: WEAK, MEDIUM, STRONG
•	User feedback with specific tips for improving password strength
•	Multiple retry attempts allowed if password is not strong initially
•	Simple command-line interface with user prompts and clear messages for interaction
